      <p>Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service owned by Facebook.The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed.</p>
     <p>Instagram Stories is rolling out globally for iOS and Android over the next few weeks.

You could call it Snapchat for adults, a way for brands to post more without overwhelming people’s feeds, an alternative to Instagram’s Like-driven success theater or a blatant ripoff.</p> <div class="w3-row">

      <h3><b>HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A ACCOUNT IS REAL OR FAKE? </b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
    <p>It's trivial to create an account on most websites, forums, and social networking sites. As a result, anyone can create a fake account that appears to be that of another person, company, or product. Below are the steps and helpful tips you can follow to help determine if an account is real or fake.
      </p><ul>
      <li>Verified account
</li>
<p>Social networking companies are aware of the problems that can be caused by fake accounts on their networks. That's why big social network sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter offer official verification of accounts. A verified account has a badge check mark next to the account name, indicating it's verified by a real person as a real account.</p>
<li>	Using default profile picture or fake picture
</li><p>If the account has the default profile picture (not a person) or is the same as other accounts, it's likely a fake account. If you're trying to verify if a Facebook account is a legitimate, you can also look through their photos to see if more than one photo is posted. Often a fake account has no photo or one photo they've randomly found on the Internet.</p>
<li>	Is following more people than they have followers
</li><p>On services like Instagram and Twitter, if a person follows more people than people following them by a large percentage, it's often a clear sign of a fake account. Often a person who creates fake accounts create a script (bot) that automatically follows other people in the hopes that they follow them back and increase their follower count.</p>
<li>	Recent join date
</li><p>If the service lists an account creation date, and the account was created recently, this information may indicate that the account is not to be trusted.</p>
